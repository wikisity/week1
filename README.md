create a basic web page with HTML and CSS. Include the picture of any actor/actress, a heading with their name, and a link to their wikipedia page. Underneath should be a table that lists some their movies, under table headers labeled title and year. Finally, add an input date form that allows for the user to choose the month, day and year from a dropdown menu.

Use CSS to manipulate background color, font-color, height and width of image and text. Add a border to the table with headers and manipulate size and color as well. Finally, use html heading tags to manipulate text size.
